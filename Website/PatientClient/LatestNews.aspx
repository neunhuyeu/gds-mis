        <h3>Electronic Aspirin</h3>
        <p>
            For people who suffer from migraines, cluster headaches, and other causes of chronic,
            excruciating head or facial pain, the "take two aspirins and call me in the morning" method is useless.
            Doctors have long associated the most severe, chronic forms of headache with the sphenopalatine ganglion (SPG)
            a facial nerve bundle, but haven't yet found a treatment that works on the SPG long-term.
            A technology under clinical investigation at Autonomic Technologies, 
            Inc., (Redwood City, CA) is a patient-powered tool for blocking SPG signals at the first sign of a headache. 
            The system involves the permanent implant of a small nerve stimulating device in the upper gum on the side of 
            the head normally affected by headache. The lead tip of the implant connects with the SPG bundle, and when a
             patient senses the onset of a headache, he or she places a handheld remote controller on the cheek nearest 
            the implant.
            The resulting signals stimulate the SPG nerves and block the pain-causing neurotransmitters.
